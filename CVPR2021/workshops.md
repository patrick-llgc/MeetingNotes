# Workshop

## [Autonomous Driving: Perception, Prediction and Planning](https://www.adp3.org/)
- Organized by Yan Wang@Cornell
- [Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/99531482511?pwd=aUQ3RFN3WGpTOWd5R093L0J1bG53UT09)
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COgEQuqTAug)
- ML planning and prediction by Peter Ondruska @ Lyft Level 5
	- ML planning (DriveNet) with perception and HD Map as input and directly output control signal
	- ML simulation
		- Past methods: Log Replay or Scripted behavior (CARLA)
		- Proposed method: SimNet
- Persistence priors aid 3D detection with past traversals by Kilian Q. Weinberger
	- Repeated exposure helps with long tail
	- Ithaca-365
	- High entropy means static objects
	- Fast look up of past traversals
- Scaling the Perception and Autonomous Driving Systems via Efficient Data,Learning, and Simulation Techniques by Chen Wu
	- "Any time of supervision helps"
	- domain adaptation is important
	- sensor data simulation: lidar, camera (surfelGAN)
	- data augmentation
	- auto labeling
	- weak/self-supervision
- Offboard Perception for Autonomous Driving by Charles Qi
